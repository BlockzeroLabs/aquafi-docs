Welcome! The purpose of the following pages are to provide a compresensive document specifiying all the different aspects of the AquaFi protocol and the Aqua token. If you are new to AquaFi you may want to check out the :doc:`./pages/category1/overview` or the :doc:`./pages/category1/faq`

**This documentation is aimed at those who want to learn the basics of AquaFi to those who want to learn the more in-depth technical aspects of the protocol too**

Getting Started
---------------

Explore the sidebar to find more specific documentation covering other
aspects of the protocol.

Developer links
---------------

The AquaFi codebase is comprised of an ecosystem of open source components. AquaFi follows a highly modular design which allows functionality to be swapped out without a token migration - you can read more about this on the :doc:`./pages/architecture`
