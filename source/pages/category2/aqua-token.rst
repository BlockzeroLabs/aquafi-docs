Aqua Token
============

The Aqua token is the utility token that will be used within AquaFi to pay premiums to users. The AquaFi protocol will capture liquidity from staked tokens and upon unstaking, the user will be paid their fees with newly minted Aqua tokens.

Aqua Token Privileges
----------------------
The Aqua token will allow users to:

- have governance rights over almost all AquaFi related proposals and almost all AquaFi related decisions - e.g. change pool premiums - the exhaustive list is as follows:

  - Governance will be executed through timelock contract.
  
  - Base premium can be decided by the aqua community.
  
  - Updating oracle address, hander addresses, locking and unlocking of handler contracts.
  
  - Grant/Revoke Minting roles to addresses.

- exchange the token for the fees captured in the protocol proportionally - i.e. if you burn 5% of all the Aqua tokens in existence, you can withdraw 5% of all the fees captures by the protocol (**the structure for this redemption is not finalized and will be approved by Aqua token holders after launch**)
- exchange the token for the trapped liquidity in the protocol proportionally - i.e. if you burn 10% of all the Aqua tokens in existence, you can withdraw 10% of all the trapped liquidity from the protocol. (**the structure for this redemption is not finalized and will be approved by Aqua token holders after launch**)
